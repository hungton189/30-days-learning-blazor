# 🚀 Learning Blazor: A Developer's Journey

Welcome to my **Blazor Learning Journey**! 🎯

As a React developer, I am dedicating **one month** to mastering Blazor, spending **1 hour and 30 minutes per day**. This repository serves as a structured journal to document my daily progress, key takeaways, and practical projects.

## 📌 Why This Series?

Blazor is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET. Since I come from a React background, I aim to compare concepts between Blazor and React while learning.

## 📅 Learning Plan

I have divided my learning into four weeks:

### **Week 1: Blazor Fundamentals**

- Understanding Blazor Server vs WebAssembly
- Razor Syntax & Components
- Data Binding & Event Handling
- Component Lifecycle & State Management

### **Week 2: API Integration & Authentication**

- Fetching data with `HttpClient`
- Form Handling & Validation
- Authentication (JWT, Cookies)
- Role-based Authorization

### **Week 3: Advanced Blazor Features**

- Performance Optimization (Lazy Loading, Virtualization)
- Real-time Communication with SignalR
- Custom Services & Dependency Injection

### **Week 4: Deployment & Final Project**

- Deploying Blazor WebAssembly & Server
- CI/CD & Hosting on Azure
- Building a Full-Stack Blazor Application

## 📝 How This Repository is Organized
